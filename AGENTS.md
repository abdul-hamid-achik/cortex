# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI agents (and humans) working on the **cortex** codebase. This is the
canonical source-of-truth doc; `CLAUDE.md` defers to it. `README.md` is the public-facing
intro. Architecture, behavior, and contributor rules that must remain durable belong here.
Design rationale and working notes belong in the Obsidian vault at `~/notes/projects/cortex/`,
**not** the repo.

## Project Overview

cortex is a local-first, evidence-guided **agent kernel** for software-engineering agents. It
sits between an LLM and a set of specialist tools (codemap, vecgrep, cairntrace, glyphrun,
fcheap, vidtrace, tvault, veclite) and enforces a stateful reasoning loop:

```
orient → investigate → form hypotheses → declare a boundary → change → verify → preserve evidence
```

Cortex does not replace the model's planning or coding ability. It supplies what models are bad
at preserving across long tool-using tasks: a durable **case file**, explicit **evidence** and
uncertainty, disciplined **tool routing**, **bounded** changes, and **verification** tied to
user-visible behavior.

Three surfaces over one kernel (the ecosystem pattern — cf. codemap/vecgrep):

- **CLI** — human commands *and* `--json` machine output for agents (Cobra + Charm v2 lipgloss).
- **MCP server** — `cortex serve` (stdio), a 17-tool `agent` profile by default;
  `--profile all` exposes the full 24-tool operator surface.
- **studio TUI** — `cortex studio` (Charm v2 bubbletea), a live, read-only board of **all** sessions
  across every repo: the session list plus the selected case's canonical verification assessment,
  pending decision, first structured action, loop stepper, hypotheses, and bounded recent
  evidence/receipts. Auto-refreshes; `--repo`/`--active` filters; `a` toggles active-only.

**Package boundaries are part of the contract.** Dependency direction is one-way:
`cmd → kernel → {adapters, store, config, domain, ids}`; `domain` depends on nothing internal.
The `mcp` and CLI RunE handlers are *thin* and call `internal/kernel`. **Never put business
logic in `mcp` or `cmd`.** (Same rule codemap/glyphrun document for their own MCP packages.)

## The reasoning loop (what the kernel enforces)

The recommended change path is retry-safe and makes change ownership explicit:

| Action | Phase move | Gate the kernel enforces |
|---|---|---|
| `open` | new → orienting → investigating, or resume | idempotency key wins; otherwise newest active normalized goal/mode/workspace/branch/acceptance-contract match resumes; keyed retries cannot change criteria |
| `investigate` | (stays investigating) | search output recorded as *candidates*, not proof |
| `plan` | investigating → planned | every hypothesis has a **disproof path**; change tasks declare a **boundary**; uncertainty stated |
| `begin-change` | planned → changing | an actor acquires the bounded, expiring lease; competing actors lose the CAS race |
| `verify` | changing → verifying | typed claim→surface→verifier/contract receipts; registered IDs require their exact stored statement; leased tasks require the owner actor; no-diff changes require an explicit no-op acknowledgment |
| `remember` | verifying → persisting → complete | normal completion requires `verified`; registered criteria always require current bound proof; legacy tasks may preserve non-green outcomes explicitly |
| `status` / `show` | — | canonical `verified / partial / failed / unverified` assessment, bounded claim-proof manifest, decisions, lease, scope, and structured actions |

These are structural invariants (see `internal/domain/case.go` `transitions`, and the `Validate`
methods). They are enforced by state, not by prompting — the model can't skip the disproof path
by restating a hypothesis.

`Verify` retains a planned→changing→verifying compatibility path for old unleased clients. New
CLI/MCP agent flows use `begin-change`; do not remove or silently change the compatibility path
without a migration and contract tests.

Coordination metadata is durable: `case.json` carries an optimistic `revision`, optional `actor`,
`parentTaskId` / `childTaskIds`, and the current `changeLease`. `Store.Save` is compare-and-swap;
lease mutations reload and retry bounded revision conflicts, so two processes cannot both become
the writer. Cross-process task locks heartbeat while held and use owner tokens during stale-lock
recovery. Plan and hypothesis/evidence companion writes use revision-guarded transactions; verify
stages facts/raw/receipts until one revision-guarded bundle publishes them with the verifying case
snapshot, and marks it bound only if case/owner/HEAD/diff stay stable. Status and handoff stream
bounded evidence projections; Show/Studio retain bounded recent ledgers plus exact totals from one
task-locked composite snapshot. Transaction recovery runs before public evidence/receipt/raw reads,
and behavioral annotations occur only after a bound bundle wins. A
released or expired lease may be replaced. `cortex note`, `decision
request|answer|resume`, and `handoff` preserve provenance, bounded human choices, and transfer state
without treating prose as verification. Structured continuation actions always carry the case
workspace and render workspace-pinned, shell-safe human commands; begin-change actions also carry
the explicit 15-minute default TTL. General handoff JSON is hard-capped at 128 KiB while retaining
transfer-critical identity, pending decisions, and a continuation. Complete verified handoffs
budget the actual primary JSON at 90 KiB and retain the entire non-sensitive named-claim/verifier
proof closure or omit all receipts atomically with a warning. Interrupted
orientation and half-committed decision states project retry-safe repair actions. `show`,
`timeline`, and `handoff` locate central sessions by ID and accept an explicit workspace fallback
for repo-local/custom case stores.

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.25+** (module pins `1.25.5`, matching the ecosystem).
- **Git** is the hard runtime dependency for workspace identity, diffs, scope drift, and
  revision-bound verification.
- **Task** (`go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest`).
- **Bun** for docs; **glyph** (glyphrun) for E2E specs; **golangci-lint** for lint.
- Sibling tools (`codemap`, `vecgrep`, `cairn`, `glyph`, `fcheap`, `vidtrace`, `tvault`, `veclite`,
  `mcphub`) are
  **optional at runtime** — every adapter degrades safely when its binary is absent
  (`Health` returns `ErrToolMissing`; `Execute` returns a `tool_unavailable` fact). Cortex
  never fabricates a missing tool's output.

## Architecture Notes

### Adapters
- Flat `internal/adapters` package, one file per tool, sharing the unexported `tool` helper
  (binary name + fakeable `runner` + `redact.Redactor` + timeout). The flat layout lets adapters
  share exec/redact plumbing without exporting internals.
- **Flag dialects differ and matter.** codemap/fcheap/cairn/tvault use a boolean `--json`;
  **vecgrep uses `-f json` and `-n N`** (not `--json`/`--top`); **glyph uses `--format json`**
  and that flag must **precede** subcommand flags. `cairn`/`glyph` MCP subcommand is bare
  (`cairn mcp`, `glyph mcp`); `fcheap`/`mcphub` use `mcp serve`. See each adapter's doc comment.
- **vecgrep has no `doctor`** — health is `vecgrep --version`. Search first requests
  `-f json-envelope`: Cortex accepts schema v1 and the transitional schema-version-zero shape,
  rejects unknown explicit majors, and falls back to the legacy bare-array `-f json` output.
  Similar and memory outputs remain bare JSON arrays.
- Every adapter returns a normalized `Result{Status, Facts, Artifacts, Warnings, Raw}`. `Status`
  is authoritative | partial | unavailable | error. Raw (redacted) output is retained for the
  case file but **not** returned to the model by default.
- `tvault` is an execution boundary, not a content provider: it answers only permitted questions
  (project/key **availability**, capability) and **never** emits secret values.
- Repository command verifiers are the exception to external adapter discovery: only exact argv
  arrays declared under `verifiers:` in `cortex.yaml` may run. They use no shell, accept only
  `unit_test|build|lint` on the `code` surface, and fail configuration closed. Configured argv is
  arbitrary local code and remains blocked unless the trusted launcher sets
  `CORTEX_APPROVE_COMMANDS=1`; repository configuration cannot approve itself.

### Storage
- Case files are JSON/JSONL — files, not a DB, in v0.1 — under a **central, XDG-organized** root
  by default: `$XDG_STATE_HOME/cortex/sessions/<repo-slug>/<taskID>/` (path resolution in
  `internal/config/paths.go`, mirroring codemap). This keeps every session across every repo
  visible/auditable in one place and the workspace tree clean. Append-oriented ledgers
  (`evidence.jsonl`, `commands.jsonl`, `phases.jsonl`) plus snapshot documents (`case.json`, `plan.json`,
  `hypotheses.json`, `verification.json`, `decisions.json`, `summary.md`).
- Config/cache follow XDG too (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cortex`, `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/cortex`); `$CORTEX_HOME`
  or a legacy `~/.cortex` collapses config+state+cache into one dir. Repo-local storage is opt-in
  via `cases_dir` / `CORTEX_CASES_DIR`, and a pre-existing `<workspace>/.cortex/cases` is honored
  so upgrades never strand active work.
- `writeJSON` is atomic (temp + rename) so a crash mid-write can't corrupt `case.json`.
- New case directories/files are owner-only (`0700`/`0600` on POSIX). Durable free text,
  collections, ledger records, and snapshot files have hard write/read bounds.
- `case.json` snapshots also use an optimistic revision check. Treat `casefs.ErrRevisionConflict`
  as retryable only after reloading; never overwrite a stale snapshot.
- Multi-file Plan/Resolve updates go through `CommitPlan` / `UpdateHypotheses`; do not reintroduce
  separate `SavePlan` + `SaveHypotheses` writes in kernel workflows. Verification batches use
  `AppendVerificationBatch`; a later unbound batch must mask older passing proof.
- Only when cases are workspace-local (opt-in) does the kernel write `<workspace>/.cortex/.gitignore`
  (`*`) so Cortex's own state never registers as a workspace change. The central XDG default lives
  outside every repo, so no in-repo ignore file is needed.

### Redaction
- `store/redact` masks secret shapes (AWS/GitHub/Stripe/JWT/bearer/`KEY=secret`) before any
  text reaches model-visible output or a case file. It favors precision — a false positive that
  masks ordinary code is its own failure — and preserves the key name on assignments
  (`API_KEY="«redacted»"`). It is the last-line filter *behind* tvault's boundary.

### MCP server (`internal/mcp/server.go`)
- SDK: `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp` (v1.6.1). Build with `sdkmcp.NewServer`,
  register with `sdkmcp.AddTool`, typed input structs using `json:"…,omitempty"` +
  `jsonschema:"description"` (a field **without** `omitempty` is required). Transport:
  `&sdkmcp.StdioTransport{}`.
- **CRITICAL: stdio MCP output must be newline-delimited JSON-RPC, not Content-Length.** The
  SDK's `StdioTransport` already does this — do not wrap or reframe it. (A sibling tool, `glyph`,
  reported "Failed to connect" in Claude Code purely because it used Content-Length framing.)
- **All logging goes to stderr** so stdout stays pure JSON-RPC (mcphub follows the same rule).
- Kernels are built **per-call** (`kernelFor`) from the tool's optional `workspace` arg, so one
  server process serves tasks in any workspace.
- The default `agent` profile exposes 17 lifecycle, collaboration, evidence, and recall tools.
  `all` adds exactly seven operator tools (`list_tasks`, `sessions`, `timeline`, `metrics`,
  `overview`, `archive`, `unarchive`) for 24 total. Update profile tests and docs with any change.

### CLI / Charm v2
- Cobra for commands; **Charm v2 lipgloss** (`charm.land/lipgloss/v2`, **not**
  `github.com/charmbracelet/...`) for the styled view. Color is **TTY-gated** (`detectColor`):
  piped/`--json` output is plain, so agents never see ANSI escapes. Every non-interactive read
  command supports `--json` for machine output; Studio rejects it and points callers to
  `sessions --json` / `show --json`.

## mcphub registration

Cortex is registered like any other MCP server:

```
mcphub add cortex cortex serve
mcphub sync --write
```

This registers the default compact `agent` profile. Use
`mcphub add cortex cortex serve -- --profile all` only for clients that require the historical
full operator/admin surface. The `--` separates mcphub's flags from arguments passed to Cortex.

In `gateway` mode the agent sees only `mcphub`, which proxies Cortex tools as `cortex__<tool>`.
Recommended lazy pins: `cortex__cortex_open_task`, `_investigate`, `_plan`, `_begin_change`,
`_verify`, `_status`.

## Common Tasks for Agents

**Add a CLI command:** add a `*.go` in `cmd/cortex/` with a cobra command var + `init()`
registration + a thin `RunE` that builds a kernel and calls `internal/kernel`. Support `--json`.

**Add an MCP tool:** define a typed input struct (json + jsonschema tags) in
`internal/mcp/server.go`, register with `sdkmcp.AddTool`, delegate to `internal/kernel`. Thin.

**Add an adapter operation:** add a `case` in the adapter's `Execute` switch, shell out via the
shared `tool.exec` (which redacts + times out), parse the tool's `--json`/`-f json`/`--format
json` output into `Fact`s. Degrade to `unavailable`/`degraded` — never fabricate.

**Change the phase machine:** edit `internal/domain/case.go` `transitions` and add a test in
`case_test.go`. Keep the `Validate` invariants in sync (`plan.go`, `hypothesis.go`).

## Code Style

- `gofmt -s` + `golangci-lint` (config version 2; errcheck + staticcheck enabled).
- Error messages **lowercase, no trailing punctuation**; return errors, `os.Exit(1)` in `main`
  only.
- Small, testable functions; explicit error handling over panics.
- `cmd/` files carry the header `/* Copyright © 2026 abdul hamid <abdulachik@icloud.com> */`.

## Testing

- High unit coverage on the invariants: phase transitions (`domain/case_test.go`), the disproof
  and completion gates (`domain/validate_test.go`, `kernel/kernel_test.go`), routing
  (`domain/policy_test.go`), redaction (`store/redact`), scope drift and the full lifecycle
  (`kernel/kernel_test.go`, over a real temp git repo + fake adapters), case-file serialization
  (`store/casefs`).
- Adapter contract tests use a fake `runner` so no real binary is spawned; git tests use a real
  temp repo (git is a hard dependency).
- glyphrun specs in `specs/` are the E2E contract. Run with `task flows` (local only).
- `task eval` runs the eight authored lifecycle scenarios and the deterministic paired
  Cortex-versus-unassisted calibration scorecard. The paired fixtures validate scoring across
  evidence quality, disproof, scope, verification, completion honesty, recovery, and overhead;
  they are not statistical claims about model performance.

## Before Committing

`task check` (fmt + lint + test) → `task build` → `task flows` if specs changed →
`task docsbuild` when documentation or site assets changed. Keep docs
discipline: product docs in `docs/` (VitePress), design notes in `~/notes/projects/cortex/`; no
stray `.md` in the repo root beyond README/AGENTS/CLAUDE/CHANGELOG. Commit/push only when asked.

## Related projects (ecosystem)

Siblings under `~/projects`: **codemap** (structural code graph — the closest convention match:
Go CLI + config + MCP), **vecgrep** (semantic search + memory), **cairntrace** (browser specs),
**glyphrun** (terminal specs), **file.cheap**/`fcheap` (evidence stash), **vidtrace** (bug-video
evidence), **tinyvault**/`tvault` (secrets), **veclite** (cross-case recall), and **mcphub** (MCP
gateway). Cortex composes them; it does not replace mcphub.
